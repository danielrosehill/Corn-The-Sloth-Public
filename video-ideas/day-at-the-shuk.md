# Sloth's Day At The Shuk

## Tools Needed

Runaway ML or some other keyframe to motion generator and lots of patience. 

## Photos

Might have enough to get started in the first photo shoot...

## Notes

Runtime 2-3 mins

Idea is something like creating a ridiculous music video from composites based on keyframe animation. Each composite about a few seconds each. The motion keyframes would be in pairs of two or three. Three supports a medium animation frame

## Idea

Cornelius the Sloth goes has a fun day (and night) at the shuk (Shuk Mahane Yehuda)  in Jerusalem. 

When the video starts it's Mid afternoon, but Cornelius already has a packed schedule ahead of him. 

He goes for a pizza and then hangs out for a bit with a dog. He has some beer. He buys some fruit and veg. He takes a couple of selfies. 

He might pose for a couple of photos with humans. 

He stops for a nap on a tree. 

He hits up a wine bar and has some wine. 

Fade to black.
