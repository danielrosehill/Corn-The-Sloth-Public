# Cornelius The Sloth (Character Sketch)

![alt text](images/banner.png)

The purpose of this repository is to hold a character sketch and a couple of photographs intended to provide the basis for an AI avatar project. 

The character sketch is, of course, entirely ridiculous and fictitious. It roughly maps on to the joke personality I've ascribed, at least in my own head, to a plushie sloth.

I've used RunwayML To create some rather entertaining short videos based on keyframe animation. And it's an ongoing aspiration to take the wacky idea a little bit further. Hence this repository has the basic sketch and a "headshot" for thumbnails and to try out on some generative AI tools..
